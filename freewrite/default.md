hi. my name is farza.

i made this app.

if you want to write more — and want to use writing as a tool to help you think — then read this guide.

it's 5 min max.

this is not a journaling app or a note-taking app.
if you use it for that, you’ll probably use it once or twice,
and then never touch it again.

this is a tool purely to help you freewrite.

freewriting is a writing strategy developed in 1973 — it’s where you write continuously for a set time without worrying about grammar, spelling, or anything like that. a pure stream of consciousness.

i picked up freewriting many years ago.

it’s led to real breakthroughs — like helping me untangle big feelings around shutting down my last company, reflecting on my relationships, and figuring out what actually matters to me as i continuously figure out the next chapter of life.

using this app is actually super simple:

1. think of a topic to write about (ex. a breakup, a struggle at work, a new idea)
2. click fullscreen
3. click the timer
4. start writing. no backspaces allowed. don’t stop writing.

once the timer is done, it’ll fade back in — and you’ll know to stop.

that’s it.

some basic rules:

- again, no backspaces
- no fixing spelling
- little 5–10s breaks are fine, but try to not stop typing
- no need to stay on the topic you started with — let your mind wander
- no judgment — trust your mind!

it’s like your brain is gpt and you just exhaust all the tokens in your head around a particular topic — and by the end, you’ll likely feel clearer about whatever it was you were writing about.

i know 15m can sound scary for some. what do you even write about.

if you’re new to writing, try this:

before you start your working day, open this app and do a 15m session answering this simple question: “what am i working on today? why is that the most important thing for me to work on?”

and don’t stop writing for 15 minutes.

this little session is how i planned and prioritized my days for many years.

do this for 3-days straight.

i find this is an easy way to get into writing. 

you’d be surprised how easy it is to get sucked into nonsense right when the day starts — and then end up getting nothing of real value done over the next 8–12 hours.

often after this planning session, i’m 100x more clear and excited about what i’m about to do — and i usually end up changing what i originally planned, for the better.

if you don’t wanna write about work, other starting prompts i use for myself:

- “today, X happened. and it’s got me feeling really down. i think — ”
- “i had a new idea around Z today and want to think through it. basically — ”
- “i’m in love. and i just wanna talk about it. so — ”
- “i think i wanna pivot some stuff. here’s how i’m thinking about it — ”

the starting prompt is everything. so, think on it.

some people are better at writing about emotions.
some are better at writing about work or ideas.

try everything. see what works for you.

free writing is the most important skill i picked up in the last 10 years.

it’s helped me think through my my most difficult life decisions.
it’s helped me think through startups in a more thorough way.
it’s made me a better partner and friend (i like communicating with letters).
it’s helped me be happier (on my down days, i write it all out and feel better).

so that’s it! that’s the app. i hope freewriting helps you.

i know it’s a dumb little app is just a text view with some black text + a timer, but, use it’s ideas properly and it can make a big impact :).

(or it ends up being dumb and useless for you haha. find out for yourself!)

lil bonus features:

1. once you finish a freewrite session, click “chat”.

it’ll push your entry to chatgpt or claude via a query parameter to help you reflect. i also baked in my custom prompt i’ve been using for months. this little thing has helped me so much. ai is really good at helping make connections you might not see. i hope it helps you too.

2. try to scroll on the timer using your trackpad — this is how you set different times. maybe start with 5m or 10m if 15m feels like a lot. for longer sessions where i’m writing scripts or brainstorming, i do 25m.

3. there is no spellcheck. there is no markdown. this is on purpose. it doesn’t matter.

4. i’ve always felt that the font and size should reflect the mood of my writing. i’m kinda weird like that. but maybe there are other weird people like me out there haha.

for example, for more emotional entries i like a larger “24px lato”.

if i’m thinking through a new business idea, i prefer a more official-looking “18px serif”. i also added the random button to help you find the vibe you’re looking for.

5. click the clock on the bottom right to see your history. it’s all saved locally. click the file path at the top to open it in finder.
